We visited on a rainy day and it was a pleasent surprise :) it's not just for kids, adults can learn and play too! I totally recommend the planetarium. And the exhibition at the time was about animals inside out, which was very interesting.
This fantastic science museum is a great way to spend a day. There are so many interactive exhibits related to physics (with text in four languages) along with several stations where visitors can build things, such as model cars to be raced. 
If you are a family with kids visiting Helsinki area, Heureka is defenately worth the visit. There are usually some changing exhibitions, but also the permanent exhibition is really fun. 
Maybe it's true, maybe not, but unique Finnish approach, their smart attitude, minimal yet fully functional design, educational capacity and the care about real people couldn't probably be more visible and recognisable than here where the complex realm of science is translated into understandable and attractive stories and experiences, which are always highly influencing our lives and our understanding of the world we're belonging to.
One of the places in Finland if not the best. Not only for children but also fur play-minded adults. Many things to learn and experience.
What a disappointment, I was expecting a huge building with many things to see, but it was tiny and uninteresting.
Frankly, I don't know what they show now but the best Finnish inventions are not visible.
To give the gist of our visit: There is not really anything remarkable displayed in the museum.
The science part was not very strong in most of these, i.e. you would not really learn anything new, although many of the experiments demonstrated some basic physical principle or a visual illusion.
We thought spending a rainy day in Heureka Science Center would be a good idea, unfortunately it wasn't.
