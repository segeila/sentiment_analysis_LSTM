Hey folks — just creating this group so we keep in touch with all the cool stuff that’s happening in the world of deep learning. I think we should stay in warm contact now. I’ll keep posting stuff here which you’ll appreciate hopefully. You can always put notification to mute in case it’s too much info. Have a great weekend & we’ll stay in touch.
Ancient bold and the beautiful the Finnish way, enjoy. It was another great and ispiring week, thanks a lot, and good luck with capsules, the book, and all other things - hope to stay in touch and see you again. I'll appreciate your posts, thanks already for that, too.
Good morning — thought I share this pretty little present from Henna for my trip to SF. This is a secret special part I have added. It tells how unfortunate it was when we could not get our GPUs from Amazon. How frustrating and disappointed we felt. How close we were to giving up. And how Tarry and Huadong together with other deep learners showed incredible determination, power of will and dedication and saved us by setting up Google Cloud virtual machines. Have a great working week & let’s cook some cool deep learning algorithms for Nokia.
